# BASIC MULTI TOKEN ERC-1155

This simple project is an example of [ERC-1155 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) implementation.

## :speech_balloon: Description

<p align="justify">A token standard defines the smart contract and features that the token issued by it has. There are many different standards on different blockchains. The simplest categorization would be between fungible and non-fungible tokens.</p>
<p align="justify">The ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard is a type of smart contract that allows users to manage Ethereum tokens of many types. It can contain ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens and it works for all types of assets: fungible and non-fungible.</p>

This implementation was created using the [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) online code editor.
